# The chocolae a mini RPG game

## The basic turn-based RPG game using Assembly

This is my final project for Assembly class. A classic role-playing adventures game. The project is a sample of code that shows how to do the following:
* Control flow and branching
* Procedures and functions
* Save and load data from file
* Loading bitmap picture

## Game story
In a distant and faraway land, there exists a wicked sorceress who cursed the princess, transforming her into a pig. To regain her original form as the princess, the little pig must embark on a journey to hunt down the malevolent witch.

## Game function
* Explore the map
* Engage in random battles with monsters
* Utilize Attack and Magic to combat monsters or flee
* Gather items
* Leveling up the character
* Save and load game progress

## How to run the project
* Clone this project
* Just double-click the file PROJECT.EXE, but you will need to run it on an x86 CPU (I developed it on Windows XP 32-bit using TASM: Turbo Assembler).
